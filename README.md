# Cascades

This is a JavaScript implementation of `Cascades`, a solitaire card game for the Decktet by Joe Conard.

## Rules

The stock is turned over three cards at a time as in Klondike.
Cards are moved from the stock to the three foundation rows;
order does not matter within a row, but a suit must match the previous card (or the Aces in the simplified version), and the rows must be filled in order: a six cannot appear in the third row until one has been placed in the second row, and (for Crowns and the optional Aces, Pawns, and Courts) a second card cannot be added to the top row until a first one has appeared in all three rows.
